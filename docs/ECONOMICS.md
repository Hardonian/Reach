# Economics Reach supports operational scaling through tiered controls and resource-aware orchestration.

## Cost and control levers - Plan tiers and capability constraints
- Iteration/time/tool-call limits for autonomous loops
- Queue depth and dropped-event metrics for backpressure visibility

## Operating guidance - Set strict defaults for free/shared tiers.
- Use policy gates to prevent high-risk tool expansion.
- Monitor latency, replay invariant, and queue metrics to tune spend/performance tradeoffs.
