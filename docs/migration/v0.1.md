# Migration to v0.1

## Changes from pre-v0.1

### Removed Subsystems

- `mesh/`
- `federation/`
- `consensus/`
- `poee/`

**What changed**: The mesh, federation, consensus, and poee subsystems have been completely removed from the repository.
**Why**: These systems introduced unnecessary complexity ("theatre") and were not contributing to the core, production-grade determinism engine of Reach. Removing them simplifies the architecture and clarifies the repository's purpose.
**What users must do**: If you were relying on these experimental features, you will need to redesign around an external orchestration tool or single-tenant deployments. These features are no longer supported.

### Removal of Simulated Byzantine Logic

**What changed**: Functions related to simulated Byzantine fault tolerance (like `SimulateByzantine` and `SimulateConsensus`) and mock planners have been purged from the core runtime path.
**Why**: Reach in v0.1 is dedicated to a "Brutal Reality" mode, meaning what runs is exactly what executes in production. Simulation code in the runtime path creates false confidence and brittleness.
**What users must do**: Remove any configuration or code that expects Byzantine simulation.

### Deterministic Hashing Behavior Change

**What changed**: Previous hash functions omitted substrings (like `time` or `uuid`) to attempt deterministic outputs from nondeterministic inputs. This brittle behavior has been removed and replaced with strict, purely deterministic hashing.
**Why**: Substring omission created blind spots and non-deterministic behavior in edge cases. Pure determinism requires inputs to be fully replayable and hashable without stripping components out.
**What users must do**: Ensure inputs to the determinism engine are stable. Transcript hashes generated prior to v0.1 may no longer match subsequent validations.

### CLI Distribution Change

**What changed**: The CLI is now entirely distributed as a compiled binary, and standard execution paths no longer invoke `go run ./cmd`.
**Why**: `go run` is strictly for development and cannot be relied upon for stable, deterministic binary distribution. Compiling guarantees the environment boundaries.
**What users must do**: Use the compiled `reachctl` binary for execution instead of running the source dir through Go.

### Integration Hub Now Single-Tenant

**What changed**: The integration hub has been restricted to single-tenant operations only. Multi-tenancy logic has been removed.
**Why**: Multi-tenancy introduces massive complexity related to isolation, scale, and security. Simplifying to single-tenant prevents scope creep and focuses on robustness for the primary deployment model.
**What users must do**: If managing multiple distinct tenants, deploy separate integration hub instances per tenant.

### Vocabulary Simplification

**What changed**: Banned legacy vocabulary (e.g. `Envelope`, `Capsule`, `Blueprint`, `Recipe`, `Pack-Variant`, `PoEE`) has been replaced with flattened, strictly defined terminology: **Policy**, **Task**, **Transcript**, and **Event**.
**Why**: The legacy vocabulary was "theatrical" and confusing. The new terminology maps directly onto exact concrete implementation layers.
**What users must do**: Update internal operational models, doc references, and configuration to exclusively use Policy, Task, Transcript, and Event where applicable.
