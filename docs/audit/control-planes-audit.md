# Reach + ReadyLayer Control Planes Audit

Generated by `scripts/governance-audit.ts` to provide deterministic evidence of governance coverage.

## Control Plane Findings

| Control plane | Scope hint | Mutation | Git SoT dependency | SCCL shared engine | Identity attribution | Lease usage | Run linkage | Split-brain risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reach CLI | src/cli + services/runner/cmd/reachctl | present (2/2) | present (1/1) | present (2/2) | present (1/2) | present (2/2) | present (2/2) | Low/Medium |
| ReadyLayer Web App | apps/arcade | present (2/2) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | Low/Medium |
| Backend Services | services/* | present (1/2) | missing (0/1) | missing (0/1) | present (1/2) | missing (0/1) | present (1/1) | Medium/High |
| IDE Integrations | extensions/* + protocol/ide | present (2/2) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | Low/Medium |
| Web Agent APIs | apps/arcade/src/app/api/* | present (2/2) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | present (1/1) | Low/Medium |

## Governance Layer Completion Matrix

| Layer | Status | Evidence coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Git host integration | ✅ implemented | 2/2 | Webhook ingress + integration documentation are present; check-run/comment automation should stay in worker adapters. |
| Artifact registry | ✅ implemented | 2/3 | Content-addressed references and run linkage exist in runner + historical index; ensure web API parity remains aligned. |
| Policy engine | ✅ implemented | 3/3 | Unified policy contract is versioned and wired through governance DSL. |
| Reconciliation loop | ✅ implemented | 1/2 | Webhook + scheduler surfaces exist; continue enforcing deterministic queue ordering. |
| CPX interactive resolve | ✅ implemented | 3/3 | Conflict packets + resolve command path exist and are test-backed. |
| Provider SDK | ✅ implemented | 3/3 | SDK contract and conformance tests are present. |
| Onboarding flow | 🟡 partial | 2/2 | Core flows are documented but lacked a single operator runbook combining CLI + web onboarding. |

## Highest Priority Gaps

1. Consolidate onboarding into one CLI + web walkthrough with operational checkpoints.
2. Keep API parity visible between runner artifact APIs and web route adapters to avoid governance drift.
3. Continue standardizing identity + lease metadata in every mutation/audit record to reduce split-brain risk.

## Risk Register

- **Identity drift risk:** Medium — multiple control planes exist, so every mutation must carry tenant + actor + run IDs.
- **Split-brain risk:** Medium — git/web/CLI pathways can diverge when lease checks are skipped.
- **Operational risk:** Low/Medium — deterministic queueing and replay are in place but should remain hard-gated in CI.
