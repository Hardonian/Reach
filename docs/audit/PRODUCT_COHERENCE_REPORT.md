# Product Coherence Integrity Test

## One-sentence explanation test
**Candidate sentence:** Reach is a deterministic execution platform that makes every run replayable, policy-governed, and audit-verifiable.

## Does the sentence match reality?
**Mostly yes**, but reality now includes enough adjacent governance and platform surface that first-time users may not perceive determinism as the active center.

## Is determinism still the anchor?
**Technically yes, experientially weakening.**
Determinism remains deeply embedded in specs and verification posture, but front-door experience competes with governance/compliance breadth.

## Has governance/compliance overshadowed usability?
**Partially yes.**
The product demonstrates assurance strength faster than it demonstrates operator/developer speed.

## Has the CLI become intimidating?
**Yes for new and occasional users.**
Power is high; conceptual compression is low.

## Has the security narrative overshadowed product value?
**In first-contact contexts, yes.**
Security appears as a dominant theme rather than a confidence multiplier for the core use case.

## Core identity drift
- Drift from “deterministic execution product” toward “governance-heavy control plane.”
- Drift from “single clear journey” toward “multi-surface evaluation maze.”

## Messaging inconsistency
- OSS-first positioning coexists with enterprise-signaling density that can feel contradictory.
- Fast-start expectations are at odds with a broad conceptual prerequisite set.

## Value proposition confusion
- For some personas, Reach appears essential risk infrastructure.
- For others, it appears optional procedural overhead.
- This divergence indicates value articulation is no longer tightly centered.

## Phase 7 — Final Market-Fit Certification (Direct Verdict)

### 1) Is Reach market-coherent?
**Partially.** The technology thesis is coherent; the product experience and narrative hierarchy are not consistently coherent across personas.

### 2) Is it persona-aligned?
**Unevenly.** Security/compliance and executive evaluators are aligned; developer/operator personas show variable alignment.

### 3) Is it adoption-ready?
**Conditionally.** Ready for controlled pilots in high-governance environments, not broadly ready for low-friction general adoption.

### 4) Single largest remaining blind spot
**Onboarding compression failure**: too much conceptual load before first undeniable value moment.

### 5) What must be removed, not added?
**Remove parallel first-contact paths and duplicate “overview” surfaces.** Keep one canonical journey and demote the rest.

### 6) What is overbuilt?
**Front-door governance/compliance signaling and multi-surface information architecture.**

### 7) What is under-communicated?
**The shortest path from install to measurable operational win** (e.g., prevented regression, reproducible failure root-cause, deterministic rollback confidence).

## Certification conclusion
Reach is credible but not yet narratively disciplined enough for broad-market adoption efficiency. The blocking issue is not missing capability; it is excessive front-door complexity and diluted product center.
