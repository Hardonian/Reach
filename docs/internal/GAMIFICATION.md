# Gamification Gamification rewards safe outcomes only and never grants security-sensitive privileges.

## Rules - XP for safe completions, replay verification, and successful delegation.

- Streaks count consecutive active UTC days.
- Badges: Determinist, Policy Paladin, Federation Scout, Debugger.
- Level unlocks are cosmetic only (theme/flair/run-card-style).

## Safety rationale Gamification is updated from event stream metadata and does not alter execution semantics, policy gate behavior, signing, audit, or replay invariants.
