# Governance

## Maintainers

Reach is maintained by core repository maintainers responsible for roadmap,
release gating, and security response coordination.

## Decision process

- Design changes should start with a spec or issue.
- Breaking changes require explicit migration notes.
- Security-sensitive changes require maintainer review.

## Release authority

Maintainers control release tags and publication workflows after all required
checks and release gates pass.
