**Status**: Early Beta  
**Tag**: `v0.1.0`

---

## Overview

Reach v0.1 is the first public beta release of the deterministic execution fabric for autonomous agents. This release establishes the core foundation for cryptographically verifiable AI workflows.

---

## What's Included

### Core Engine

- **Deterministic Evaluation**: Bit-identical replay across runs
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete execution transcripts for audit
- **Policy Engine**: Rego-based governance with real-time enforcement
- **Fingerprinting**: SHA-256 hashes for every execution

### CLI

- `reach run` — Execute packs locally
- `reach replay` — Verify determinism through replay
- `reach export` — Create portable capsules
- `reach doctor` — Environment health checks
- `reach report demo` — Diagnostic report generation

### Verification

- Capsule format with cryptographic integrity
- Cross-machine replay verification
- Tamper-evident execution artifacts
