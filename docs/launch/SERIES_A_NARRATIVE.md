# Series A Narrative: The Operating System for Agentic Compute

## 1. Category Framing: The 4th Wave

- **Wave 1:** Models (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Wave 2:** Vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **Wave 3:** Orchestration Frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT)
- **Wave 4 (Now):** **Governance & Measurement (Reach)**

_Thesis:_ Enterprises cannot deploy autonomous agents without a guarantee of safety, auditability, and cost control. Reach provides that guarantee.

## 2. The Problem

Current agent frameworks are "black boxes." When they fail, you don't know why. When they overspend, you find out a month later.

## 3. The Solution: Reach

Reach is a **deterministic execution fabric**. It treats agent actions like database transactions: atomic, replayable, and governed by policy.

## 4. Differentiation

| Feature      | Zapier/n8n          | LangChain   | **Reach**               |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| **Focus**    | Low-code Automation | Prototyping | **Production Runtime**  |
| **Replay**   | No                  | Partial     | **Bit-perfect**         |
| **Security** | OAuth only          | App-level   | **Kernel-level Policy** |

## 5. The Moat

1. **Evaluation Corpus:** As users run Reach, they build a proprietary dataset of "what works" vs "what fails" for specific models.
2. **Signed Packs:** The "App Store" for agents. Once developers rely on Signed Packs, switching costs become prohibitive.
3. **Telemetry:** Granular cost/latency data that no other platform captures.

## 6. Revenue Expansion

- **Land:** Developer tools (CLI, Local Runner).
- **Expand:** Team Collaboration (Shared Registry, CI/CD Integration).
- **Scale:** Enterprise Control Plane (Policy Enforcement, Audit Logs).

## 7. Use of Funds (Series A)

- **Engineering (50%):** Harden the Federation Protocol, expand Language SDKs.
- **GTM (30%):** Developer Relations, Solutions Engineering for Enterprise.
- **Ops (20%):** Cloud Infrastructure, Security Audits.

## 8. The Close

"We are building the Kubernetes for Agents. The infrastructure layer that makes autonomous systems boring, reliable, and profitable."
