## Elevator Pitch

### 25 Words
Reach makes AI decisions deterministic and auditable. Every decision gets a cryptographic fingerprint that can be replayed and verified—providing total transparency for production AI.

### 50 Words
Reach is a deterministic decision engine for autonomous agents and complex workflows. It evaluates decisions under multiple scenarios, applies policies, and produces cryptographically-verifiable outputs. Same input always produces the same output with full audit trails. Essential for AI systems where you need to prove what happened and why.

### 100 Words
Reach brings determinism and auditability to AI-powered decision-making. Unlike traditional AI systems that behave unpredictably, Reach guarantees that the same input always produces the same output—a critical requirement for production systems in finance, healthcare, and infrastructure.

Every decision is fingerprinted using cryptographic hashing, creating an immutable record that can be replayed exactly as it happened. Policies enforce safety constraints at the engine level, while federation support enables distributed consensus across multiple nodes.

Built in Rust and Go for performance, Reach integrates with existing AI systems to add the provenance and replayability required for mission-critical deployments.

## Boilerplate Copy

### Short (50 words)

Reach is an open-source deterministic decision engine that brings cryptographic provenance and bit-identical replay to AI systems. It ensures that decisions are auditable, verifiable, and reproducible—essential requirements for production AI in regulated industries. Learn more at reach.dev.

### Medium (100 words)

Reach is a high-performance, deterministic decision engine for autonomous agents and complex workflows. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate as black boxes, Reach provides cryptographic provenance and bit-identical replayability for every decision.

The engine evaluates scenarios under uncertainty, applies configurable policies, and produces decisions that can be independently verified and exactly replayed. Same input always produces the same output, across runs and platforms.

Built in Rust and Go, Reach is MIT licensed and designed for mission-critical applications in finance, healthcare, and infrastructure where decision accountability is paramount. Visit github.com/reach/reach to get started.

### Long (200 words)

Reach is a production-grade deterministic decision engine that solves the accountability problem in AI-powered systems. While traditional AI provides powerful capabilities, it often operates as an opaque black box—making decisions that cannot be reproduced, audited, or verified. Reach changes this paradigm by ensuring every decision is cryptographically proven and bit-identically replayable.

At its core, Reach evaluates decision scenarios using expected utility theory, applying user-defined policies to ensure safety constraints are never violated. The engine produces a cryptographic fingerprint for every decision—a SHA-256 hash that uniquely identifies the exact input, execution path, and output. This fingerprint enables unprecedented transparency: any decision can be replayed exactly as it happened, on any platform, at any time.

Reach is designed for mission-critical applications where decision accountability matters. Financial institutions use it to prove trading algorithm decisions for compliance. Healthcare providers audit AI diagnostic recommendations. Infrastructure teams automate scaling with full accountability. Autonomous system developers replay incident decisions for root cause analysis.

The engine is built for performance and portability. Core components are written in Rust for speed, with Go services for orchestration. It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows with identical results. The MIT license encourages adoption and contribution.

Reach represents a fundamental shift: from trusting AI to proving AI. In a world increasingly powered by algorithmic decisions, this transparency isn't just valuable—it's essential.

```
When AI makes decisions that affect people's lives, how do you prove it made the right call?

Traditional AI is a black box. Decisions go in, results come out, but the reasoning is opaque and unverifiable.

Reach changes this. Our deterministic decision engine produces cryptographic fingerprints for every decision—enabling full audit trails and bit-identical replay.

Same input. Same output. Every time.
