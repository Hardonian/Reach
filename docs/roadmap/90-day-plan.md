# Reach + ReadyLayer 90-Day Plan by Governance Layer

| Layer | 30-day deliverables | 60-day deliverables | 90-day deliverables | Risks | Dependencies | Metrics of success |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Determinism | Expand replay fixture coverage and deterministic-order audits in CI. | Add multi-tenant replay stress checks with stable hash assertions. | Publish determinism SLO dashboard and incident runbook. | Hidden nondeterministic paths in new adapters. | `verify:oss`, engine-core tests, fixture corpus. | replay mismatch rate, deterministic test pass rate. |
| DGL | Standardize severity mapping across CLI/web/check outputs. | Changed-only semantic scans defaulted for all gates. | Pre-merge drift prediction scoring for risky subsystems. | False positives can block adoption. | DGL gate scripts, canonical language config. | gate precision/recall, median DGL runtime. |
| Supervisory Intelligence | Unify actor/run/tenant audit schema. | Escalation analytics + notification routing. | Auto-recommend policy tuning based on historical denials. | Alert fatigue from noisy policies. | audit log schema + notification channels. | escalation MTTR, acknowledgement compliance. |
| CPX | Enforce deterministic conflict packet + merge-plan output path. | PR acknowledgement workflow tied to packet severity. | Guided conflict-resolution UI with explicit human approvals. | Unsafe merge automation pressure. | CPX CLI + DGL deltas + policy engine. | conflict resolution lead time, post-merge defect rate. |
| SCCL | Add lease-renewal telemetry and stale lease alerts. | Reconciler-driven lease recovery and branch freshness checks. | Branch orchestration with lock-aware queueing defaults. | Lease starvation under high concurrency. | lease store, reconciliation worker, audit logs. | stale lease count, lock contention latency. |
| Git Integration | Harden webhook/check/comment adapter for GitHub App. | Reviewer routing + label automation from policy outputs. | GitLab API parity for comments/checks/labels. | Token scope misconfiguration. | webhook receiver, policy engine, recon loop. | check publish success rate, webhook processing latency. |
| Artifact Registry | Validate hash-index and run linkage invariants. | Retention policy enforcement + paginated retrieval hardening. | Immutable manifest attestation + integrity drift alarms. | Storage growth and retention mistakes. | storage layer, run records, retention controls. | artifact retrieval p95, integrity check pass rate. |
| Policy Engine | Normalize policy evaluation logs across CLI/web/release gates. | Add simulation mode for non-blocking policy rollout. | Risk-zone adaptive escalation ladders in production gates. | Policy sprawl and contradictory rules. | governance-policy config + audit sink. | policy eval latency, bypass frequency, false-block rate. |
| Reconciliation Loop | Wire webhook and scheduler through deterministic queue contract. | Add automated stale-branch/missing-run detection coverage. | Closed-loop alerting + auto-remediation playbooks. | Retry storms during host outages. | job queue, webhook API, SCCL lease APIs. | drift detection SLA, dead-letter rate. |
| Provider SDK | Publish adapter contract + deterministic example adapter. | Expand conformance suite for telemetry/token accounting. | Certify third-party adapters with compatibility badges. | Adapter quality variance. | SDK interface, fixture responses, test harness. | conformance pass rate, adapter onboarding time. |
| UX / Onboarding | Ship unified CLI + web onboarding runbook. | Add first-PR guided walkthrough with policy hints. | Persona-specific templates (platform team, product team, solo dev). | Friction in first-run setup. | CLI commands, wizard UI, docs. | time-to-first-governed-PR, activation rate. |
| Security | Redaction regression suite for logs/artifacts/SARIF. | Supply-chain verification gate policy in CI. | Quarterly threat simulation with remediation scorecards. | Third-party dependency exposure. | secret scanners, lockfile policy, audit logs. | secret leak incidents, critical CVE remediation SLA. |
