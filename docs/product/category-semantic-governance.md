# Semantic Governance Category Definition

Git control planes govern file transitions.
Reach governs **semantic state transitions**: meaning-bearing changes across model, prompt, policy, context, evaluation, and runtime descriptors.

## Why this is AI-native
- Determinism provides stable semantic state identifiers.
- Drift taxonomy explains *what meaning changed*, not only that bytes changed.
- Replay integrity verifies that a semantic transition can be reproduced.
- Policy snapshots make governance contractual at decision time.
