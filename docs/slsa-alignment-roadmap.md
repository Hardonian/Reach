# SLSA Alignment and Roadmap

## 1. Introduction

SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) is a security framework providing a checklist of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure. It is a model for increasing confidence in the software supply chain.

This document outlines our honest, self-assessed alignment with the SLSA framework and provides a roadmap for achieving higher levels of compliance.

## 2. Current Self-Assessment: SLSA Level 2

As of today, the Reach project meets most requirements for **SLSA Level 2**. This level indicates that the provenance of the artifact is generated by a hosted build service and that the service is trusted to be secure.

### How We Meet SLSA Level 2:

-   **Version Controlled Source (`SLSA L1`)**: All source code is managed in a Git repository hosted on GitHub.
-   **Scripted Build Process (`SLSA L1`)**: Our builds are fully scripted via `Makefile` and CI workflow files (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). There are no manual steps.
-   **Hosted Build Platform (`SLSA L2`)**: We use a trusted, well-known hosted build platform (GitHub Actions) to produce all official release artifacts.
-   **Provenance Generation (`SLSA L2`)**: The build process generates provenance that identifies the artifacts produced (`SHA256SUMS`), the source commit hash, and the builder (GitHub Actions). Our `cosign` signatures and SBOMs serve as our form of provenance.

## 3. Roadmap to SLSA Level 3

SLSA Level 3 requires stronger guarantees against tampering from both the build platform and other users. It introduces requirements for hardening the build environment and preventing unauthorized changes.

Here are the specific gaps we have identified and our roadmap to close them.

### Gap 1: Build runners are not ephemeral or isolated on a per-build basis.

-   **Problem**: Standard GitHub Actions runners may reuse environments, which could theoretically allow a compromised runner to affect a subsequent build.
-   **Roadmap**:
    -   **Q2 2026**: Migrate our release build workflow to use ephemeral, single-use runners. This ensures that each build starts from a clean, trusted state.
    -   **Q3 2026**: Investigate using a hardened, minimal container image as the build environment to further reduce the attack surface.

### Gap 2: Provenance is not generated by the build service itself in a standard format.

-   **Problem**: We currently generate our own integrity artifacts (SBOMs, signed hashes). SLSA L3 prefers that the build platform itself generates and signs a non-forgeable provenance attestation (e.g., using the `slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator`).
-   **Roadmap**:
    -   **Q2 2026**: Integrate the `slsa-github-generator` into our release workflow to produce SLSA-compliant provenance attestations alongside our existing `cosign` signatures.
    -   **Q3 2026**: Update our documentation and verification scripts to show users how to verify artifacts using the official SLSA verifier.

### Gap 3: Source history is not sufficiently protected.

-   **Problem**: SLSA L3 requires that source history is retained and protected from tampering. While GitHub provides this, additional controls are recommended.
-   **Roadmap**:
    -   **Q1 2026 (Complete)**: Branch protection rules are enabled, requiring code review.
    -   **Q2 2026**: Enforce a two-person review policy for all merges to the main branch, especially for changes to the build and release workflows.
    -   **Q4 2026**: Evaluate requiring signed commits from all core maintainers to further attest to the origin of all code.

## 4. Beyond SLSA Level 3

SLSA Level 4 is the highest level of assurance, requiring a two-person review of all changes and a hermetic, reproducible build process.

-   **Hermetic Builds**: This would require ensuring the build script fetches no external dependencies at build time. All dependencies would need to be pre-fetched and vendored. This is a significant engineering effort that we will evaluate after achieving SLSA L3.
-   **Dependency Audits**: While we audit dependencies, a Level 4 posture would require a much deeper, manual review of critical dependencies, which is currently beyond our resource capacity.

## Conclusion

We are committed to a secure and transparent supply chain. Our immediate goal is to fully meet all SLSA Level 3 requirements within the next 12 months. We believe that this provides a strong, verifiable guarantee of integrity for our users while remaining achievable for our team.
