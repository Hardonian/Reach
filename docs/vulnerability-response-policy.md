# Vulnerability Management and Response Policy

## 1. Introduction

Project Reach is committed to the security of its users. This document outlines our policy and process for managing and responding to security vulnerabilities discovered in the Reach project. Our goal is to provide timely and transparent information to our users so they can protect their systems.

We encourage all users and security researchers to report potential vulnerabilities to us by following the process in our `SECURITY.md` file.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to the Reach CLI tool and any official extensions or libraries maintained in the primary Reach repository.

## 3. Severity Level Classification

We classify vulnerabilities using a simplified, impact-based scheme. This helps us prioritize our response.

| Severity | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | Vulnerabilities that can lead to arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or widespread information disclosure without significant user interaction. | - Remote Code Execution (RCE) in a parsing library.<br>- A plugin vulnerability that allows sandbox escape.<br>- Compromise of a release signing key. |
| **High** | Vulnerabilities that can compromise the integrity or availability of the tool, or disclose sensitive user data under plausible conditions. | - A denial-of-service vulnerability triggered by a common input.<br>- A bug that leaks environment variables to logs.<br>- A bypass of a core security policy. |
| **Medium** | Vulnerabilities that have a limited impact, require significant user interaction to exploit, or are mitigated by default configurations. | - A denial-of-service vulnerability triggered by a highly unusual, complex input.<br>- A minor information leak that does not include sensitive data.<br>- A security misconfiguration in a non-default setting. |
| **Low** | Vulnerabilities with minimal security impact, such as a theoretical weakness with no known exploit path or an issue in developer-only tools. | - Inefficient error handling that does not leak information.<br>- A flaw in a development-only script. |

## 4. Response Process and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

Our response process follows these steps:

1.  **Triage**: A private report is received via our responsible disclosure channel.
2.  **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of the report to the sender.
3.  **Validation**: The core team validates the vulnerability and assigns a severity level.
4.  **Remediation**: We develop and test a patch.
5.  **Release**: We release a new, patched version of Reach.
6.  **Disclosure**: We publish a security advisory.

Our target SLAs are based on the assigned severity:

| Severity | Acknowledgment | Remediation & Release | Public Disclosure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | < 24 hours | < 7 days | Within 24 hours of release |
| **High** | < 48 hours | < 21 days | 1-3 days after release |
| **Medium** | < 3 business days | < 90 days | With the next scheduled release |
| **Low** | < 5 business days | Best effort | At our discretion, may be bundled in release notes |

## 5. Disclosure and Communication

-   **Security Advisories**: For all Critical and High severity vulnerabilities, we will publish a security advisory on GitHub. The advisory will contain details about the vulnerability, the versions affected, and remediation steps (i.e., upgrading to the patched version).
-   **CVEs**: We will request a CVE identifier for all vulnerabilities that are publicly disclosed.
-   **Release Notes**: All security fixes, regardless of severity, will be noted in the release's `CHANGELOG.md`.

We are committed to a policy of **coordinated vulnerability disclosure**. We will work with the reporter to ensure that we do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a patch is available and users have had a reasonable amount of time to upgrade, according to the SLAs defined above.
