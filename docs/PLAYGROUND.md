# Reach Playground Reach ships a zero-install static playground exporter:
- `reachctl playground export [--output file]`

The generated HTML is restricted to `arcadeSafe.demo` configuration and demonstrates policy gate awareness, deterministic replay messaging, graph concept messaging, and safe share links (base64-encoded non-secret config).
