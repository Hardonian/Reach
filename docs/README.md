# Reach Documentation Hub

Welcome to the Reach documentation. This documentation is focused on the open-source, local-first architecture of Reach.

## Core Concepts

- [Determinism Specification](DETERMINISM_SPEC.md) — How we ensure bit-for-bit identical execution.
- [Replay Protocol](REPLAY_PROTOCOL.md) — Verifying execution validity via local replay.
- [Storage Specification](STORAGE.md) — Local-first artifact and run storage layout.

## Pivot to OSS-First

- [OSS First Pivot Plan](OSS_FIRST_PIVOT_PLAN.md) — Our strategy for moving to an OSS-default architecture.
- [Component Map](OSS_FIRST_COMPONENT_MAP.md) — Classification of OSS vs enterprise components.
- [System Boundaries](BOUNDARIES.md) — Import and layering rules for local safety.

## Roadmap

- [Milestone Kilo](ROADMAP_KILO_DETERMINISTIC_CI_GOVERNANCE.md) — Focus on stability and determinism.

## CLI Reference

- See `reachctl --help` for locally-available commands.
- See [CLI.md](CLI.md) (Work in Progress) for detailed usage guides.
