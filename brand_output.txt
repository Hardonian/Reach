validate:brand ΓÇö FAIL: found 1 residual "Reach" occurrence(s):

  apps\arcade\src\components\OSSModeBanner.tsx:4  ΓåÆ  * OSS mode banner showing that Reach is running in local-only mode.

Fix: replace visible "Reach" text with "ReadyLayer", or add an allowance in scripts/validate-brand.ts if it is an internal identifier.
