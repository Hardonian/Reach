Audit existing UI first; extend/merge only. In this Reach repo, generate UI improvements ONLY for the scoped routes below, and do not duplicate or rewrite any route already scored strong (3). Preserve existing Next.js App Router routing, links, and navigation structure. Reuse existing primitives/components where possible (`ConsoleLayout`, `EmptyState`, `DegradedBanner`, existing stitch panel/table styles). Maintain OSS vs Enterprise boundaries (no cloud SDK or enterprise-only imports in OSS core paths). Every touched route must render safe loading/empty/error states and must never hard-500. If theming/tokens already exist, provide full light/dark parity and avoid hard-coded one-off colors unless already used by the route. Scope: (1) Replay/Determinism: `/demo/evidence-viewer`, `/decisions/[id]` with panels for evidence ingestion, verify/replay actions, transcript/metadata, gate results. (2) Governance/Gates: `/console/governance/config-as-code`, `/settings/release-gates` with policy packs, validation results, gate list/editor, run-history panel. (3) Console Operations: `/console/alerts`, `/console/traces`, `/monitoring` with alert inbox/severity badges/ack drawer, trace explorer with detail panel, monitoring signal/threshold/incidents panels. (4) Docs/Help: `/support/contact` with submission status and fallback channel panel. (5) Marketing: `/roadmap`, `/whitepaper` with timeline/index cards and evidence links. Constraints: no new top-level routes, no dashboard sprawl, consolidate panels into authority pages above, preserve current API contracts and route params, and keep all existing content unless replaced by stronger equivalent UI in the same route.
