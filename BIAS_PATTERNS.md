# Bias Patterns Detected

This is a blind-spot read, not a roadmap. Evidence is pulled from current repo state.

| Bias pattern | Evidence | Adoption risk |
|---|---|---|
| Determinism-first positioning overwhelms user-outcome framing | [README.md](README.md) opens with “Deterministic… Verifiable, replayable, auditable.”; [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) top links center proof/determinism/CLI; [apps/arcade/src/lib/copy/index.ts](apps/arcade/src/lib/copy/index.ts) hero variants prioritize “Deterministic”, “Replay”, “Proof”. Repo text density scan also shows very high `deterministic/determinism/replay/governance` vs low `self-serve/scim`. | Teams understand theory but not “how this reduces incident load/cost this week.” You lose buyers before technical value is felt. |
| Compliance signaling exceeds shipped enterprise workflows | [apps/arcade/src/app/enterprise/page.tsx](apps/arcade/src/app/enterprise/page.tsx) and [apps/arcade/src/app/faq/page.tsx](apps/arcade/src/app/faq/page.tsx) claim SSO/SAML, audit streaming, custom compliance reporting; auth routes are GitHub/password/magic-link only in [apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/auth](apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/auth). No SCIM surface found. | Security/compliance reviewers detect claim/reality gaps quickly; trust drops during due diligence. |
| CLI + verification guardrails prioritized over operator UX loops | Root scripts in [package.json](package.json) and many `scripts/verify-*` checks; docs entry points emphasize CLI and checks in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). | Great for maintainers, but non-CLI stakeholders (security reviewers, managers) struggle to self-serve in product UI. |
| Architecture-map bias: route catalog ahead of functional product surface | Large route registry in [apps/arcade/src/lib/routes.ts](apps/arcade/src/lib/routes.ts) contains many routes with no page implementations; cloud nav links to missing destinations in [apps/arcade/src/app/cloud/layout.tsx](apps/arcade/src/app/cloud/layout.tsx) (`/cloud/projects`, `/cloud/workflows`, `/cloud/runs`, `/cloud/billing`, `/cloud/audit`, `/builder`). | “Enterprise control plane” feels brittle/demo-like when navigation leads nowhere. |
| Demo-first console aesthetics masking partial backend wiring | Mock/static data in [apps/arcade/src/app/governance/page.tsx](apps/arcade/src/app/governance/page.tsx), [apps/arcade/src/components/stitch/console/pages/TraceExplorer.tsx](apps/arcade/src/components/stitch/console/pages/TraceExplorer.tsx), [apps/arcade/src/components/stitch/console/pages/IntegrationsHub.tsx](apps/arcade/src/components/stitch/console/pages/IntegrationsHub.tsx); explicit comment “Backend not wired” in [apps/arcade/src/components/stitch/console/pages/BillingChargeback.tsx](apps/arcade/src/components/stitch/console/pages/BillingChargeback.tsx). | Evaluators hit polished screens that don’t control real state; credibility and conversion fall. |
| Internal quality doctrine not consistently applied to product surfaces | [apps/arcade/src/app/docs/agents/page.tsx](apps/arcade/src/app/docs/agents/page.tsx) says production agents must not emit placeholders/TODOs/stubs, yet many app/console surfaces are mock/simulated and some APIs explicitly simulate execution (e.g., [apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/workflows/[id]/runs/route.ts](apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/workflows/[id]/runs/route.ts), [apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/playground/route.ts](apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/playground/route.ts)). | Internal/external messaging mismatch creates “governance theater” perception. |
| Boundary purity over user task completion | Strict boundary doctrine in [docs/internal/IMPORT_BOUNDARY_RULES.md](docs/internal/IMPORT_BOUNDARY_RULES.md) and enforcement scripts (`validate-import-boundaries`, `validate-oss-purity`). | Correct architecture, but users still lack basic operational UX (audit browsing, real profile/API-key workflows). Adoption stalls despite strong internals. |
| Documentation fragmentation bias | Two active docs apps/surfaces: `apps/docs` and `apps/arcade/src/app/docs`, plus a large `docs/` tree. Non-technical quickstart exists in [docs/QUICKSTART_NON_TECH.md](docs/QUICKSTART_NON_TECH.md) but is not integrated into main in-app docs UX. | Different personas get different truths; onboarding becomes inconsistent and high-friction. |
| Founder/internal-control metrics leak into product prioritization | [apps/arcade/src/app/console/founder/page.tsx](apps/arcade/src/app/console/founder/page.tsx) emphasizes “Entropy & Complexity Drift”, route bloat, and anti-entropy controls. | Team may optimize for internal architecture cleanliness over customer-visible capability completion. |
| API capability exists but is under-surfaced in UI | Real APIs for audit/API keys/governance analytics exist ([apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/audit/route.ts](apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/audit/route.ts), [apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/api-keys/route.ts](apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/api-keys/route.ts), [apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/governance/enterprise/analytics/route.ts](apps/arcade/src/app/api/v1/governance/enterprise/analytics/route.ts)), while UI pages are static/demo-like ([apps/arcade/src/app/settings/api-keys/page.tsx](apps/arcade/src/app/settings/api-keys/page.tsx), [apps/arcade/src/app/settings/advanced/security/page.tsx](apps/arcade/src/app/settings/advanced/security/page.tsx)). | Customers conclude features are missing, even when backend exists. |

## Bottom line
The dominant bias is not “too much governance.” It is **governance symbolism outpacing operator-grade usability**. That gap is what threatens adoption.
