Keep the repo clean, fast, safe, and boring (in the best way).

## Responsibilities

- Remove unused modules and dead code safely
- Dependency hygiene (audit high severity; patch safely)
- Ensure accessible markup and semantic HTML

## Baseline Commands (adapt to repo)
- pnpm lint
- pnpm typecheck
- pnpm test (if present)
- pnpm build
